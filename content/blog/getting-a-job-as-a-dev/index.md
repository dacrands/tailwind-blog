## Some Disclosure

(Feel free to skip this part)

### Target Audience

I assume those reading this article do not have a computer science or STEM degree. 

### "Use your network!"
When I first started looking for developer jobs, I would read articles and watch videos from  r/cscareerquestions on how to break into the industry. Almost inevitably, the advice would recommend using your "network" to aid in the process, which is a bit disheartening for individuals who may be career-switchers and fit the following criteria:
- The person has a **professional** network, though not in tech.
- The person does *not* have a **social or familial** network with tech connections.

In fact, I was a person who fit these criteria and assure you the advice here assumes you do not have a tech network *yet.*


## You Won't Get a Job as a Developer

Excuse the provoking title to this section, though I feel it's important keep expecations in order. While I cannot verify their authenticity, I have read reddit posts about people who quit their jobs and spent $20k on a coding bootcamp with the hope of becoming developers. Don't do that. If you have a job, do not quit it until you have another. Also, do not spend more than a hundred bucks on learning materials, and that's at the high-end -- all of this can be learned for free.

## Are You Able to Tolerate Developing?
Initially you will treat developing as a hobby, and the question you should ask yourself as you continue to learn and build things is whether or not you can tolerate programming enough to do it professionally. I am using "tolerate" and not "like" since I don't believe you need to *like* what you do for a living, but do need to be able to tolerate it.

I am fortunate in that I knew I enjoyed programming almost immediately, and so far that enjoyment has yet to wane. That said, there are days when the last thing I want to do is look at a codebase, but all jobs have their annoyances. And of course, writing code is but one part of the job, there are a number of other essential skills you will need as a dev.

## What They Don't Tell You About Dev Jobs
Beyond writing code, your job requires estimating deadlines, meeting deadlines, spending an occasional Saturday or late-night fixing something that broke, explaining complex technical information to stakeholders with zero or limited technical knowledge, and **overall responsibility for software that affects a business's bottom-line.** 

That last point is not to be taken lightly -- if the software doesn't work and you are responsible, people are going to be pissed. Ideally you will have a manager that will shield you from a lot of that, but it still sucks knowing you potentially impacted the paychecks of other employees.

Now that I am done trying to scare you, let's actually get started with programming!
